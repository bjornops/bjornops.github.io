I recently listened to a podcast with the authors of *You Can Change Other People* and was inspired by their approach to helping people change.

## Changing People

There may be a lot of reasons to change others, but manipulation is not one of them.
This change process is based upon helping others changing themselves, with the foundation that they agree with the improvement potential.

Reasons to wanting to change another person should align more with either
> *This other person is affecting me negatively*

or
> *I see a missed opportunity for this other person*

And of course, this can be applied to yourself as well!

## A Four Step Framework

Bregman defines four steps to helping people change:

1. Be an ally
2. Focus on outcome
3. Look for opportunity
4. Create a plan

These are phases I really like, because they lay the foundation for all types of change and is a mature way to look at a problem.
It changes the perception of the problem and the attitude towards it.

### From Critic to Ally

<!--
- Negative emotions are a manifestation of a positive intent.
- Why is the person exhibiting this behavior?
- Become a partner and resource for the other person
- Compassion and empathy
-->

Their first point is to change perspective.
You need to be empathetic to the other person.
This will help you to change your attitude towards the problem and your phrasing of your perception of the problem.
You have to become a partner and maybe a resource for the other person, or else you'll probably be seen as a critic and reduce your chance of influence.

With that frame of mind you can also step out of a state of frustration and into curiosity, and for instance explore why the other person is exhibiting their behavior.

### Focus on Outcome

<!--
- Focusing on the problem doesn't make for a good state of mind
- The problem uncovers a difference between the current state and the wanted state
- Don't focus on the problem, focus on outcome
-->

One major challenge is to reframe the problem as only a hindrance to an outcome.
That is, the outcome should be of prime focus, not the problem itself.
The outcome is a positive objective at a higher level, whereas the problem is not contributing to the outcome.

There was one quote by Howie Jacobson that was especially intriguing to me

> *Negative emotions are a manifestation of a positive intent.*

This implies that negative emotions are revealing a difference in the current state and the state that you want or expect.

Every annoyance or problem that you perceive can be used as a tool to find out how you want your world to be.
It's only a problem in relation to the outcome you want.

### Look for Opportunity

<!--
- Given the outcome and problem, how can the problem help us achieve the opportunity, and not just eliminate the problem.
- Leverage the person's attributes.
- Feedback won't always help (Telling an aggressive person they're aggressive)
-->

There are simple ways to handle problems, such as eliminating them.
However, this can be quite ineffective and little motivating.

The complex method, and maybe the more rewarding, is to see what opportunities are available.
What are the underlying issues of the problem?
What positive thing does this problem serve, and is there any other way to achieve this?
Is there a need that is not met, and the problem is just a coping mechanism or symptomatic treatment?

These are opportunities that can be explored and utilized in order to achieve the desired outcome.

### Create a Plan

<!--
- The plan is not revolutionary.
- Setting SMART goals, using a Level-10 Plan.
- Follow through, not success.
-->

Lastly, the plan.
The authors are referencing some plan types, but I don't think these are revolutionary in any way, but still important to follow through on the desired behavior change.
Using SMART goals or a Level 10 plan can be useful alternatives in order to execute and fulfill the opportunity of the problem.

One thing that the authors mentioned that I find useful, is that the plan is important as a tool to follow through - not to succeed.
The plan is an experiment that can be successful or not, and if it's not, then create a new plan.
The main goal is the outcome, not the plan!

## Summary

Once again, I really enjoyed this because the effect this framework has on the sentiment and emotions related to the problem.
