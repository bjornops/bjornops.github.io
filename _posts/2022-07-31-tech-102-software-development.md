## Introduction to Software Development

For you that don't have clue about what's going on.

### Fundamentals

Software is generally speaking a program. A program has multiple nicknames: program, application, app.
There are also many types of programs: Games, text editors, web pages, information storage, web browsers, operating systems, just to name a few.
Everything that happens after pressing the `ON` button on the device is software. The name **software** comes from the fact that it is changeable, whereas the device itself is called **hardware** while it cannot (at least not easily) be changed as it is a physically constructed, soldiered thing.

Some software is delivered in *.exe* or *.dmg* files (for Windows and Mac respectively).
Opening these kinds of files in a text editor does not make any sense, because they are compiled.
Compilation is necessary to make the code understandable by the operating system.
Let's focus on the *code* part.

Code, or source code, is the description of the program behaviour - what it should do and how it should respond to different actions.
The code can be written in many sorts of languages, though limited to a set depending on the use case of the program.
Some example languages are C, Java and Python.

When creating a program that has many use cases or is fairly complex, it can be useful to collaborate on the development.
The code *can* be shared in Dropbox or similar technologies, but that often leads to unforeseen changes in the code while working on it.
Thus, developers use *source code management* or *version control* applications to cooperate, typically GitHub or GitLab.

This covers the absolute basics of software development, and is just the tip of the iceberg.

**TODO: add sources**



### Roles

#### Front-end (web dev)
UI. Implements (writes code) what the designers have designed

#### Backend
Data provider. Makes data available for front-end.

#### Architect
Designs how the different components of the system should utilize each other.

#### Data engineer
Implements a data pipeline that separates and conjoin data in their respective places, making the data available to the correct groups of applications and people.
