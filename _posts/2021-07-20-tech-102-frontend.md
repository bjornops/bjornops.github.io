In this article series I'm trying to make technology concepts more accessible for everyone.
If you're new to tech, either just starting out your programming career, trying to do your job as a recruiter or just are curious, these articles are for you!

In the last article (TODO LINK) we had a peek at the overall technology stack.
Now it's time to look a little closer at the components and tie in some names.
Let's deal with frontend first.

## The Basics

Now, there are many PRODUCTS/brands/names? (Vue, etc. - I'll do some namedropping later on), but to make any sense of them, we need to know the fundamentals of the web frontend.
Have a little patience, I'll try and make it short!

There are many analogies to technology and here I'll use one from a recent discussion from some colleagues.
The human body.

There are three essential components of a modern web page, although only one is strictly necessary; HTML.

<!--TODO: Skip example?-->

HTML is an abbreviation of HyperText Markup Language and looks something like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <p>General Kenobi</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

This is not supposed to be a programming guide, so it's not getting more advanced than this. *(Phew)*.

The purpose of HTML is structuring the content of the web page.
To the bodily analogy, it could be a structure starting from the torso, attaching the overarm, then the underarm, the palm and finally fingers.

This isn't particularly unique, though, and represents practically every human to date.
To represent a single human, we also need to define the looks.
That is done by CSS.

Cascading Style Sheets are 

- HTML: Structure
- CSS: Looks
- Javascript: Logics

Hei! 
Tips til ny artikkel kan jo være å 
ta utgangspunkt i et nettside eller app hvor du skriver litt konkret om hvordan den er laget? Da kanskje forklare hva som er gjort; 
frontend, API, backend, mikrotjenester, databaser, eventstrøm osv? 

Rett og slett litt sånn om hvorfor appen/nettsiden fungerer. Trenger nok ikke være såå detaljert, men mer for å feste kunnskapen til et konkret produkt/tjeneste. Kanskje også noe om de typiske rollene i dette arbeidet? 

Hadde vært spennende med litt info om ulike rammeverk og språk som kan brukes, evt. kanskje det passer i en tredje artikkel?
